*WP All Import Pro* is a $99 upgrade that adds the following features to the free version of WP All Import:

* Import to Custom Post Types - commonly used to import to Automotiv, OpenHouse, Listings, and WooCommerce, as well as any other theme or plugin that makes use of Custom Post Types.

* Cron Job/Recurring Imports - WP All Import pro can check periodically check a file for updates, and add, edit, and delete to the imported posts accordingly.

* Import data to Custom Fields - used by many themes, especially those using Custom Post Types - to store data associated with the posts.

* Import images to the post media gallery - WP All Import can download images from URLs in an XML or CSV file and put them in the media gallery.

* Import files from a URL or FTP server - Download and import files from external websites or FTP servers, even if they are password protected. FTP imports support wildcard patterns, i.e. *.xml, so for example you could download and import all XML files in a certain folder.

* URL and FTP imports are integrated with the recurring/cron imports feature, so WP All Import can periodically re-download the files and add, edit, and delete posts accordingly.

* Execution of Custom PHP Functions on data, i.e. use something like [my_function({xpath/to/a/field[1]})] in your template, to pass the value of {xpath/to/a/field[1]} to my_function and display whatever it returns.

* Pro version customers also get access to our customer portal with documentation and tutorials, and e-mail technical support.
